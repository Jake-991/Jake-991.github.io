# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
## Project Overview
As a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, our goal is to analyze and understand the different usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. The director of marketing believes that maximizing the number of annual memberships is crucial for Cyclistic's future success. Therefore, our team aims to derive insights from the data to inform a new marketing strategy that can effectively convert casual riders into annual members.

## Objectives
Analyze Usage Patterns: Investigate how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
Data-Driven Recommendations: Provide compelling data insights to support the design of a marketing strategy focused on converting casual riders into annual members.
Professional Visualizations: Create professional data visualizations to present our findings to Cyclistic executives for approval.

## Data Analysis Questions
How do casual riders and annual members differ in their usage of Cyclistic bikes?
What trends and patterns can be identified from the ride data?
How can these insights be used to develop targeted marketing strategies?

## Project Structure
Data Collection: Gather and preprocess ride data from Cyclistic's bike-share system.
Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the dataset.
Comparative Analysis: Compare the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members.
